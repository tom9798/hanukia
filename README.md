# hanukia
TOM's hanukia for the disabled

changes made from origin: the arduino will go into stdby mode after 45 mins if at least one of the leds is on, els after 5 secs, in order to save power. that way we dont need a physical switch, since it won't be as comfortable for a disabled person. 

pins to solder:
button - pins 2 and 13
leds - pins 3-11
